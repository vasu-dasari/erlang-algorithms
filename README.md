### About the project

The goal of this project is to implement some useful algorithms and data structures in Erlang so as to help anyone who may need them.

*  Currently Implemented Data Structures:
	*  Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted Graphs
	*  Min / Max Heaps
	*  Union / Find

*  Currently Implemented Algorithms:
	*  BFS
	*  DFS
	*  Dijkstra
	*  Kruskal
	*  Edmonds-Karp
	*  Ford-Fulkerson
	*  A*

### How to Compile and Run

*  Compile the source code and the demo : `make`
*  Run dialyzer : `make dialyzer`
*  All of the above : `make all`
*  Run the demo : `make demo`
*  Make edoc : `make edoc`

The files in the `demo` folder contain functions that demostrate the code in action.
